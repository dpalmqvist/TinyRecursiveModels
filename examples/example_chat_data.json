Deep learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence 'deep'). The key difference is that deep learning can automatically learn features from raw data, while traditional ML often requires manual feature engineering. Deep learning excels at tasks like image recognition and natural language processing."
